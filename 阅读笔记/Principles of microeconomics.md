# Ten principles of economics

## Knowledge
### 1. Learn that economics is about the allocation of scarce resource.
A society faces many decisions. A society must decide what jobs will be done and who will do them. It needs some people to grow food, other people to make clothing, and still others to design computer software. Once society has allocated people to various jobs, it must also allocate the output of goods and services that they produce. It must decide who will eat caviar and who will eat potatoes. It must decide who will drive a Ferrari and who will take the bus.

### 2. Examine some of the tradeoffs that people face.
"There is no such thing as a free lunch." <u>To get one thing that we like, we usually have to give up another thing that we like.</u> Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another.

### 3. Learn the meaning of opportunity cost.
<u>The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.</u> When making any decision, such as whether to attend college or university, decision makers should be aware of the opportunity costs that accompany each possible action. In fact, they usually are

### 4. See how to use marginal reasoning when making decision.
Economists use the term **marginal changes** to describe small incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action. Keep in mind that "margin" means "edge," so marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what you are doing.
<u>A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit of the action exceeds the marginal cost.</u> This principle can explain why airlines are willing to sell a ticket below average cost and why people are willing to pay more for diamonds than for water

### 5. Discuss how incentives affect people's behavior.
Because rational people make decisions by comparing costs and benefits, they respond to incentives.
<u>When analyzing any policy, we must consider not only the direct effects but also the indirect effects that work through incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause people to alter their behavior.</u>
 
### 6. Consider why trade among people or nations can be good for everyone.
Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off.
Clearly, your family gains much from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.

### 7. Discuss why markets are a good, but not perfect, way to allocate resource.


### 8. Learn what determines some trends in the overall economy.
